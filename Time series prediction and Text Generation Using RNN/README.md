# Recurrent Neural Networks course project: time series prediction and text generation

### Amazon Web Services

Instead of training your model on a local CPU (or GPU), you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.  Please refer to some instructions for setting up a GPU instance for this project.
